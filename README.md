Problem:
There are parents out there, who like to go with their children to playgrounds in the morning or in moody weather.
And those parents often experience empty playgrounds. And why go to a playground if itÂ´s empty?

Solution:
The Goal of this project is to create a web application, which enables parents to search for different playgrounds in their area.
Key Feature of this application is to check-in and out from playgrounds.
With that feature, parents can see in a map, where other parents have already checked in, so they have the opportunity to go there too.
